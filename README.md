# Overview

This project provides a python scripts to simulate the wave propagation from 
an open water body into an 
aquifer. Simulations can be performed via the numerical
solver ModFlow throught the Python API flopy or using a semi-analytical solution.
The code comes along three input waves: a tidal wave, an artifical square wave
and the time series of a river.
